# Tiny-World
Tiny World is a lightweight system-tray AI assistant that reads text from your clipboard and provides instant answers or code. Trigger requests with hotkeys (s+c for code, s+q for questions), get results copied back to the clipboard and receive desktop notifications, all while running quietly in the background.
